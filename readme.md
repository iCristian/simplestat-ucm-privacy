# Demo of Hosting or Deploying ionic 4 app on GitHub pages

> Github pages allows you to host static websites and web apps for free using the same workflow you use to host repositories, you just commit and push. Build and Deploying of static website to GitHub Pages can be automated. You can even associate a custom top level domain name to your website or web app by adding a CNAME file.

## Prerequisites

- Ionic requires latest Node.js version
  - To check your version, run node -v in a terminal/console window.
  - To get Node.js, go to https://nodejs.org
- npm package manager
  - To check your version run npm -v in a terminal/console window
  - Install npm client - https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install
  
## Install Ionic

```
npm install -g ionic
```
> The -g option means install globally.

## Start an app

Create an Ionic app using one of the pre-made app templates, or a blank one to start fresh. 

```
$ ionic start ionic-github-pages-demo tabs
âœ” Preparing directory ./ionic-github-pages-demo - done!
âœ” Downloading and extracting tabs starter - done!
...
```

## Run the App

```
$ cd ionic-github-pages-demo/
$ ionic serve

> ng run app:serve --host=localhost --port=8100
[INFO] Development server running!
       Local: http://localhost:8100
```

## Create a Repository on GitHub

- Goto your GitHub Home page -> Repositories -> Click New
- Specify your repo name ionic-github-pages-demo
- Leave it public and add a README file
- Create Repo

You should find instrutions to push an existing repository from the command line:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/hoodaajay99/ionic-github-pages-demo.git
git push -u origin master
```
> GitHub Pages allows you to create `single sites per GitHub account and organization` and `unlimited project sites`. Detailed instructions are provided here `https://pages.github.com/`

## In your angular project, add new remote for GitHub

```
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/hoodaajay99/ionic-github-pages-demo.git
```
Verify

```
$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/hoodaajay99/ionic-github-pages-demo.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/hoodaajay99/ionic-github-pages-demo.git (push)
```

## Build your ionic app
Navigate in the terminal to your project directory and execute `ionic build --prod -- --base-href https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`

```
$ ionic build --prod -- --base-href https://hoodaajay99.github.io/ionic-github-pages-demo
> ng run app:build:production --base-href https://hoodaajay99.github.io/ionic-github-pages-demo
...
```
This will create the www folder with output bundles for your ionic application.

## Add `angular-cli-ghpages` npm module to your project.

```
$ cd angular-github-pages-demo
$ ng add angular-cli-ghpages
```

> `angular-cli-ghpages` is npm module which simplify the build deploy process for angular apps. It is build on top of https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages


## Deploy your project to GitHub pages.

Then run the plugin `npx angular-cli-ghpages` with --dir=www as input. Your angular application will be deployed to `gh-pages` branch of your repository.

```
$ npx angular-cli-ghpages --dir=www
Username for 'https://github.com': <username>
Password for 'https://<username>@github.com': 
ðŸš€ Successfully published via angular-cli-ghpages! Have a nice day!

```

## Verify/Update GitHub Pages settings

- Goto Github repository settings -> GitHub Pages section
- Make sure `Source` is set to `gh-pages` branch. 
- Your site is published at https://hoodaajay99.github.io/ionic-github-pages-demo/

> Your site may still not be accessible, because github pages by default looks for sites made with jekyll.

## **Important:** Add .nojekyll file to root of your `gh-pages` branch

It is now possible to completely bypass Jekyll processing on GitHub Pages by creating a file named .nojekyll in the root of your pages repo and pushing it to GitHub.

> Site is accessible at https://hoodaajay99.github.io/ionic-github-pages-demo/

> Note: It may take some time for the application to be become available, since github servers take some time to update the site.
